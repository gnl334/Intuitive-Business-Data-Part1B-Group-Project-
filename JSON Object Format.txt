This is the file to define what the structure of the JSON version of the VPL program should look like

{
    "Policy Name" : "Example",
    "Data Sources" : [ \\ List of all the data sources that the policy will act of],
    "Nodes" : [ \\ List of all the nodes in the program
        {
            "Index" : \\ Pick a node index. All nodes must have a unique index
            "Type" : \\ Type of the node (eg ADD),
            "Position" : \\ Rendered position of the node in the VLP [x, y]
            \\ More options are possible depending on the node type
        }
    ],
    "Connections" : [ \\ List of all the connections between nodes in the program pairs from input node to output. The order matters as in the case that the inputs of the block are not commutative then the inputs are in the same order as this list. Connections must form an acyclic graph.
        [0, 1]
    ]
}

Design Decisions:
 - Node positions are stored as this allows programs to be reloaded to the front end without having to decide where they will be placed on the page.
 - Data Sources are predefined so that the relivenet data sources can be requested as early as possible to improve execution time.

 - This implementation doesn't allow for programs to be run at different rates. This could be done by having a relational database that stores what files should be run at what time interval. This still required for this database to be polled at some rate.
